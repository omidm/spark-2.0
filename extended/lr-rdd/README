Logistic regression program, applying the regression algorithm over a
collection of input samples in form of RDDs.

After launching master and slaves use the spark-submit script as follows:
  
../../bin/spark-submit
      --conf spark.eventLog.enabled=true
      --conf spark.eventLog.dir=../../log-dir
      --class MyKMeans
      --master spark://<master-url>:7077
      --deploy-mode client
      --executor-memory 4g
      target/scala-2.10/logistic-regression_2.10-1.0.jar
        <Int dimension>
        <Int iteration_num>
        <Int partition_num>
        <Float sample_num in million>
        <Int spin_wait in micro seconds>

If the spin wait value is non-zero it replaces each clustering calculation with
a spin wait that last as long as the argument (in micro seconds).


Makefile options:
    $ make                to build
    $ make start          start a master and slave locally
    $ make stop           stop master and slave locally
    $ make run            to run an example againt local master and slave
    $ make run-events     activate event logging as well
    $ make run-multiple   activate events and two stage implementation
    $ make clean          clean generated binary
    $ make clean-logs     clean log directories
    $ make clean-all      clean generated binary and also log directories
